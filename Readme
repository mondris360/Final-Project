Project Name: Hospital Management System

This web application allows hospitals,  to easily manage their patients by allowing them to perform the following tasks:
1; Add new patient record
2: Checkin a patient and assign a doctor to the patient
3: View all checked in patients
4: Edit patient's record: // I got stuck  while doing this
5: Add a new doctor account


TECHNOLOGIES USED
1: HTML5
2: CSS 3 AND CSS GRID
3: JAVASCRIPT
4: JSON MOCK API
5: SOME JQUERY methods e.g Ajax call, event listener e.t.c

THINGS TO DO, TO COMPLETE THE PROJECT.
1: Working on the edit patient function and the modal box
2: Improving the entire UI
3: making it mobile friendly/ responsive by adding media query to handle different break points.
4: creating sessions and adding the logout function
5: encrypting the password using a standard password encrypting algorithm like SHA256
6: checking if user's name already exist by binding an Ajax call to the onChange event listener to check if the username already exists in the database
7: and other ideas/ functions that might come up while building the project


Note: I have decided to pause this project and focus on learning a proper backend language(Node JS), a database management system(MYSQL)
and rebuild the entire project from scratch in a more standard and scalable way.
