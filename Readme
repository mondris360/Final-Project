Project Name: Hospital Management System

This web application will allow hospitals  to easily manage their patients by allowing them to perform the following:
1 Add new patient record
2:Checkin a patient and assign a doctor to the patient
3:View all checked in patients
4:Edit patient's record: // i got stucked doing this
5:Add new doctor account


TECHNOLOGIES USES
1: HTML5
2: CSS 3 AND CSS GRID
3: JAVASCRIPT
4: JSON MOCK API
5: SOME JQUERY methods e.g the Ajax call, event listener

Note: i have decided to pause this project and focus on learning a proper backend language(NODE JS), a database management system(MYSQL)
and rebuild the entire project from scratch in a more standard and scalable way.
